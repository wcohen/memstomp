MEMSTOMP memcpy checker

NOTES:
	memstomp checks the operation of memcpy. In particular memstomp
	warns when memcpy is used to copy overlapping regions of
	memory (such as the problem encountered in
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=638477)

        Just use it as prefix for your usual command line and it will
        check memcpy used in all child processes. Example:

                memstomp gedit

       The tool understands a --debug-info switch in which case the
       backtraces generated will include debugging information such as
       line numbers and source file names. This is not enabled by
       default since generating those traces is not always safe in
       situations where locks are taken or memory allocated as we do
       it here. YMMV.

       memstomp also has a '--kill' option that kills the application
       at the first problem memcpy.

       Note that valgrind can perform this type of check also.
       memstomp merely lowers the overhead for this type of check.

        Exception:

        backtrace-symbols.c is GPLv2+. Which probably means that using
        the --debug-info switch for memstomp might not be legally safe
        for non-GPL-compatible applications. However, since that
        module is independantly built into a seperate .so it should
        still be safe using the profilers without this switch on such
        software.
